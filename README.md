Revision is hard. I tried anki a while ago. I felt that it prioritises memorising over understanding. 

# Features

scan or import photos of notes or copy and paste. read the notes. create a few prompts to help with the next step. recreate notes without looking at them at all. edit notes so that a competent five year old with no prior understanding of the subject, could understand. grade your understanding. repeat.

# Intended Result

An app that one can upload notes to in seconds and revise in a manner that creates understanding over pure memory.
